# Affiliate Automation Status

Affiliate product integrity for SilkierStrands is governed by the single canonical **Weekly Affiliate Link Health-Check** in the Trail Built Overland repository.

The job runs every Monday at 15:00 Pacific Time, covers SilkierStrands alongside Trail Built Overland and PauseAndFlourish, and emails its report to the owner (address kept out of the repo).

It validates the full mapping chain for every product:

```text
Local product name → ASIN → generated affiliate-link ASIN → Amazon catalog title
```

Amazon Creators API `GetItems` is the source of truth. Public Amazon-page validation is only a fallback when Creators API credentials are unavailable. The optional catalog refresh uses `scripts/fetch-prices.js` with `CREATORS_API_CLIENT_ID`, `CREATORS_API_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `CREATORS_API_PARTNER_TAG`.

> Legacy PA-API 5.0 jobs, daily price-sync workflows, and standalone link-check/mapping schedules are retired. Do not recreate them. Extend the canonical weekly health-check instead.

The detailed operating rules are maintained at [`Trail-Built-Overlanding-Site/AFFILIATE_AUTOMATION.md`](https://github.com/bootnylee/Trail-Built-Overlanding-Site/blob/main/AFFILIATE_AUTOMATION.md).

## Shared Deploy Confirmation

For every agent-initiated push to `main`, run the shared engine immediately after the push:

```bash
python3 /home/ubuntu/trail-built-overland/tools/deploy_confirmation_remediation.py \
  --mode post-push --site silkierstrands --expected-sha <pushed-commit-sha> --auto-remediate
```

The engine generates the concise deployment-confirmation email draft for the owner (address kept out of the repo), verifies this site’s `version.txt` marker, and applies only the approved strict remediation actions. The canonical weekly health-check calls the same engine for reconciliation. Do not create a site-specific deploy-confirmation schedule, duplicate engine, secret, or threshold exception.
